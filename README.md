Initially I wanted to run a linear regression to find an average bitcoin price across cycles because I think that bitcoin's four year cyclical behavior is not priced in. 
If people thought that bitcoin's behavior was cyclical and reliable they would all trade on it and the price would normalize instead of swinging cycle over cycle.
The linear regression is an approximation of the price I think that bitcoin would normalize to if its cyclical behavior was priced in. I also ran an exponential
regression fit but I think that exponential growth is unsustainable and bitcoin actually breaking the current exponential best-fit line is unlikely as we get
more data. IMO buying bitcoin anywhere below the linear best-fit line is going to be profitable and actually justifies buying significantly above market price
during bear markets which is STILL generally profitable.

Second part of this notebook I created two indices of top altcoins and memecoins (picked four top memecoins and six top altcoins) 
and averaged out their prices, scaled them along with bitcoin price, and visualized them on the same plot in order to see where relative 
cycle tops and bottoms occur compared to each other. You can see that there's pretty clear correlation between bitcoin and the indices and that 
bitcoin generally moves first with altcoins moving slightly behind. As of 6/3/25 the altcoin market and bitcoin are still correlated but decoupled with the 
difference between the altcoin trend line and the bitcoin trend line demonstrating bitcoin's current dominance.
Based upon what we've seen before altcoins in this situation rapidly catch up and then generally outperform bitcoin which has happened twice before in previous
cycles, you can see how in the past the relative peaks of altcoins during previous cycles top out relatively above bitcoin. I am not 100% sure if this decoupling
is permanant or if it's a temporary divergence from the trend.

I also ran a rolling 90 day correlation graph for both altcoin where you can see the correlation between bitcoin and the indices generally increases during
market pumps and decreases during sideways trading, suggesting that when traders buy in bulk many of them all generally buy in to multiple coins at the same time.

Graphing the price of multiple coins on the same plot makes it clear that the whole market pretty much always moves together which means that when 
traders buy as a group they are buying across the board, asset agnostic, and a lot of those traders are buying multiple assets simultaneously. This means that
trading any specific asset within the crypto market gives exposure to the motion of the entire market, maybe it's a fallacy to think about buying a specific
coin and rather more important to trade the whole market as an average over a long period of time if literally all of the assets are correlated.

I am not sure why there are easy no tools online to easily overlay multiple price charts for different assets that would make it abundantly clear how heavily
correlated all of the assets within the market are, it's literally that if a group of people are buying they are buying everything at the same time and not 
favoring specific assets, and if they ARE favoring specific assets I am pretty sure that quickly reverts to the mean.
